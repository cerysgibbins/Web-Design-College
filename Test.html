         <h3>Evaluation</h3>
         
         
         <p>Out of all the reviews I received back they all had one thing in common. They all stated apart from one that the colour scheme of the web site was more appealing to girls and that because the web site is about giving out information about computer code that is wasn't appropriate. But, then the tester said that it doesn't really matter as long as the information is there. Someone suggested that I should have something to do with electricity, web or a circuit diagram to show that the web site has an IT matter. I completely agree with this idea and I believe that it would work very well with the web site and make it look more in the IT matter. </p>
         <p>Another thing that some of the reviews had in common was when the user click on certain pages they can't really tell which page they're on due to not having a clear enough title. One of the testers suggested that I should put a strong background colour behind them or make them a little larger so the users know which page they're on. I also agree with this idea as I think it would be beneficial to the users that are using the web site.</p>
         <p>On certain web pages they are submenu's and someone stated that they aren't very clearly and you can't really tell that they're links for another page. I agree with this feedback because the submenu's don't really leap out and you can't tell that they're links and they're very hard to identify. For me to improve this I believe that I could either put a border around the submenu to display that it's part of the web site and to show that there are more pages of the web site or I could do a vertical version menu like the main menu as one of my testers suggested. I believe that this is a good improvement to do because users wouldn't know that it's part of the navigation.</p>
         <p>One of the testers pointed out that the button on one of the JavaScript pages does not work properly. This was because the college network wouldn't accept the command and therefore they were blocking it for it not to work as it was suppose to. After I got given back the feedback I tested the button myself. The button does work but the user would have to allow the scripted window in order for them to enter their name into the prompt box. After the user allows the scripted window they would need to click back on the button and then enter their name. Some users may find this annoying as they would need to accept the scripted window in order for the button to work properly and to allow them to enter their name. For me to improve this I could have an input box on the page instead of a prompt box. However, this is no longer as a problem as I have now improved this problem by have an input box instead of a prompt box as you don't really see many web sites with prompt boxes. Also, I changed this because it's easier for the user because before they would need to refresh the web page in order for them to input anything into the prompt box. I believe that changing this is an improvement because some of the users might have found it frustrating to refresh the page every time before they could input anything into the box.</p>
