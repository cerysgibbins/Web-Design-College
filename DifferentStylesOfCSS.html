          <h3>Different Styles Of CSS</h3>
          <p>There are three different ways of linking HTML to CSS.</p>
          <div id="CSSStyles">
              <ul>
                  <li>External Style sheet</li>
                  <li>Internal Style sheet</li>
                  <li>Inline style</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
          
          <p>All three different styles can be displayed differently:</p>
          
          <div id="CSSStyles">
              <ul>
                  <li>Inside an HTML element</li>
                  <li>Inside the head section of the HTML page</li>
                  <li>Or in an external CSS file</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
          
          <h3>External Style Sheet</h3>
          
          <p>The External Style Sheet is a separate document that allows you to set the same style to all of your HTML pages. You can set all the paragragph elements to the same text and colour without you having to give them all different ID's.</p>
          <p>If you wanted to use the External Style Sheet you would need to use the following tag in all of your HTML pages. Here's the code below:</p> 
<pre>&lt;link rel=StyleSheet href="external_style_sheet.css"type="text/css"&gt;</pre>
          <p>If you put the tag above in all of your HTML pages then all of your HTML pages will have the same styles from your External Style Sheet, so all your HTML pages look the same. Below is an example of the code in an External Style Sheet: </p>
                                      		
                                            
<pre>p {margin-left:20px;} body {background-image:url("images/back40.gif");}
</pre>
                                            

		<p>Some advantages of using the External Style Sheet is that if you edit a file then all of the HTML pages will also be updated, without you having to edit each page. Also, the External Style Sheet separates all the content coding on your website from the appearance coding on your website.</p>
        <p>Some disadvantages of the External Style Sheet is that you have to flick back and forth to the stylesheet for you to add any coding. Also, you will need to make sure that you copy and paste the HTML code on each HTML page.</p>
              
        <p><b>External Style Sheets are very good because they allow users to control the style of each individual style sheet.</b></p>
          
        <h3>Internal Style sheet</h3>
          
        <p>The Internal Style Sheet is normally used when a HTML page has its own unique style. The Internal style gets defined in the head section of the HTML page and are defined by using the &lt;style&gt; tag. Here is an example: </p>
            
<pre>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Internal Style Sheet Example&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
         
body { background: #C9F1C5 }
h1 { color: #54B24B; font: bold 14px Verdana, Arial, Helvetica }
p { font: 12px Verdana, Arial, Helvetica }
          
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
</pre>
                  
       <p>If you wanted to you could apply these styles to the text within your HTML page and then the style will be displayed. A disadvantage to this is that with the Internal Style Sheet you will need to declare all the styles on every HTML page you make and this could be time consuming.</p>
       <p>An advantage for using the Internal Style Sheet is that its easier for the user because they can code and style their website in one HTML document and another advantage is that the code appears to render more quickly.</p> 
                  
       <p><b>Internal Stylesheets are good to use because they allow the user to identify styles for a HTML page.</b></p>
                  
       <h3>Inline Style</h3>   
                 
        <p style="color:sienna;margin-left:20px">The Inline Style is a style attribute that gets used in the relevant tags. For example, for this paragraph I have used a style attribute to make the text a different colour from the rest of the paragraphs. The style tag that I used was: </p>
                     
<pre>&lt;p style="color:sienna;margin-left:20px"&gt;</pre>
                        
       <p>An advantage of Inline Styles is that they are also easier and quicker for you to code your website. A disadvantage to using the Inline Stlyes is that you can't reuse the styles.</p>
                     	
       <p><b>The Inline style is good to use because changes can be made to the HTML code straight away.</b></p>
                     
                     
      <p><b>Out of all of the styles that I have discussed I believe that the best style to use is the External Stylesheet. I think this because the External Stylesheet is a seperate sheet and therefore doesn't make your HTML code look cluttered or messy. It will also be more benefitical having the CSS code in a seperate sheet because new users who haven't coded before may get confused which code is HTML and which code is CSS, so therefore they wouldn't muddle up them.</b></p> 
      <p><b>Using an External Style Sheet is an advantage because like I said before users can control the style of each individual HTML page inside one CSS style sheet. User's will need to make sure that they have saved the HTML pages and the CSS style sheet in the same document for this to work.</b></p>
